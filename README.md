    "index": 3,

## üì∏ Accessing Generated Images

The actor saves an "album.html" file to the KeyValue store for easy browsing and downloading of generated images. You can access it by:

- Clicking any "Album URL" field in the results table
- Going to Run > Storage > KeyValueStore and finding the "album.html" file

The album interface provides several features:

- Filter images by prompt text or other metadata
- Select multiple images for batch operations
- Open images in new tabs for detailed viewing
- Download selected images as a ZIP file

Here's an example album showcasing some generated images so you can see how your results will be displayed: [Browse Example Gallery](https://igolaizola.github.io/midjourney-automation/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Usage Guidelines and Best Practices

### Account Safety

- Automation of Midjourney accounts can result in termination
- Only use for batch jobs you would normally do manually
- Avoid running the automation 24/7
- Follow Midjourney's terms of service

### Performance Optimization

- Start with 1-2 concurrent jobs and adjust based on results
- Use proxies from your region for better reliability
- Set job timeouts appropriate for your chosen generation mode
- Regular cookie updates may be required for long sessions

### General Tips

- Test your setup with a small batch of prompts first
- Use descriptive prompts for better organization
- Monitor success rates and adjust settings as needed
- Failed jobs are logged but won't stop the entire process
- Privacy mode affects image visibility in your Midjourney profile
